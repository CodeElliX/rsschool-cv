## About Me

I work as a veterinarian and a year ago I decided to make a major career change. My choice was front-end development.

I study on my own, on various platforms, such as freecodecamp, rs-school, learn javascript, etc.

I thoroughly studied html, css, native js. I received a certificate for free Shi-Codes courses. Now I’m finishing learning React/Redux.

I am also currently a participant in a course from rs-schools, which helps me refresh my knowledge, close gaps and structure previously received information.

## Code example:

    if(currentWeapon < weapons.length -1){

    if(gold >= 30){
    gold -= 30;
    currentWeapon ++;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeapon].name;
    text.innerText = "You now have a " + newWeapon + ".";
    text.innerText += " In your inventory you have: " + inventory;
    inventory.push(newWeapon);
    }else{
    text.innerText = "You do not have enough gold to buy a weapon.";
    }
    }else{
        text.innerText = "You already have the most powerful weapon!";
        button2.innerText = "Sell weapon for 15 gold";
    button2.onclick = sellWeapon;
      }
